## üì´ ‚Ä¢ General:

‚Ä¢ Site introduction: 

> This is a login screen from the site called Mangools, I saw this site and I really liked this screen, so I decided to rewrite it in my format. Currently the site is only responsive with notebooks and above, I decided not to do it for cell phones and tablets out of laziness lol, but if you need or want this adaptation just create an issue and I can help you, I couldn't put all the graphic elements of the original site already that I couldn't get his source, so I made an adaptation to my eye, I hope you like it.

> Altogether it was 2 hours of work in a row doing this, thank you. The entire site has graphic elements on hover, enjoy
